      <h2>Procurement</h2>
      <p>Below you'll find a list of the various government-wide procurement options agencies can use to buy your software. There are many types of contract vehicles, but Apps.Gov is focused on listing Governmentwide Acquisition Contracts (GWACs) to maximize market reach for products listed.</p>
      <h4>Micro-Purchase Threshold</h4>
      <p>Have a product that costs under $3,500/year? Agencies and the subsequent purchase card holders can make a purchase without needing a contract. However, if the cost will exceed the threshold, a contract will be required.</p>
      <h4>Schedule 70</h4>
      <p>Schedule 70 is an indefinite delivery/indefinite quantity (IDIQ) multiple award schedule, which allows federal, state, local and tribal government entities to procure approve technologies. To be listed on Schedule 70, please check out the following information at <a href="http://www.gsa.gov/portal/content/104506" target="blank">http://www.gsa.gov/portal/content/104506</a>.

      <h4>NASA SEWP</h4>
      <p>The <a href="http://www.sewp.nasa.gov/" target="blank">NASA Solutions for Enterprise Wide Procurement (SEWP)</a> is a multi-award GWAC vehicle focused on commercial IT products and product based services. There are 147 pre-competed Contract Holders that serve as vendors of IT technologies.</p>
      <p>To be procured using the SEWP contract vehicle, a government contracting officer will submit a Request for Quote (RFQ) to the SEWP team, which is then sent out to the 147 vendors. They will identify the appropriate technology, negotiate terms, and compete the prices, which will then be returned to the government contracting officer for selection. The turn around for this process is estimated to take 4-7 business days.</p>
      <p>If you'd like to preemptively list your product with SEWP vendors to expedite the RFQ process, please reach out to <a href="mailto:help@nasa.gov">help@nasa.gov</a>.</p>
      <h4>NIH NITAAC</h4>
      <p>The National Institute of Health (NIH) <a href="https://nitaac.nih.gov/nitaac/" target="blankl">NIH Information Technology Acquisition and Assessment Center</a> is an Office of Management and Budget (OMB) GWAC for IT procurement, which consists of: CIO-SP3, CIO-SP3 Small Business and CIO-CS. If you have questions, please reach out to the NITAAC team via <a href="mailto:NITAACsupport@nih.gov" target="blank">NITAACsupport@nih.gov</a>.</p>
      <h2 name="certifications">Certifications</h2>
      <h4 name="tos">Negotiated Terms of Service</h4>
      <p>When selling to the federal government, companies will often be required to negotiate a federal-compatible Terms of Service. A list of approved negotiated ToS can be found at <a href="http://www.digitalgov.gov/resources/negotiated-terms-of-service-agreements/" target="blank">digitalgov.gov</a>, which may not be fully encompassing. Additionally, because negotiated TOS are often determined at the agency level (requiring agency legal review), there are POCs for each agency, identified <a href="http://www.digitalgov.gov/resources/agency-points-of-contact-for-federal-compatible-terms-of-service-agreements/" target="blank">here</a>.</p>
      <h4 name="pia">Privacy Impact Assessment</h4>
      <p>When personal information on individuals is collected and used as a part of a system, the product team is required to conduct a Privacy Impact Assessment (reference: <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/memoranda_m03-22" target="blank">E-Government Act of 2002</a>). A PIA or Adapted PIA may need to be written for any IT system that collects, stores, and makes retrievable people’s personally identifiable information. Further work and approval from the agency’s Chief Privacy Officer may be required. The PIA explains:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The information collected is used only for the intended purpose;</li>
        <li>The information is timely and accurate;</li>
        <li>The information is protected according to applicable laws and regulations while in GSA’s possession;</li>
        <li>The impact of the information systems on individual privacy is fully addressed; and</li>
        <li>The public is aware of the information GSA collects and how the information is used.</li>
        <li>Further work and approval from the agency’s Chief Privacy Officer may be required.</li>
      </ul>
      <h4 name="sorn">Systems of Record Notice (SORN)</h4>
      <p>Regulates the collection, maintenance, use, and dissemination of personally identifiable information (PII) about people (referred to as a “system of records”) by the government. A SORN may be required when collecting, storing, and making retrievable people’s personally identifiable information. More information regarding SORNs can be found <a href="http://www.gsa.gov/portal/content/104265" target="blank">here</a>.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>A System of Record is created when a group of information is collected and stored in a way that can be retrieved by the name of an individual, or by any number, symbol, or other unique identifier assigned to that individual.</li>
        <li>The Privacy Act requires that any system of record be publicized via a SORN, which is a notice published to the Federal Register for public comment. This process lasts a minimum of 60 days.</li>
        <li>Further work and approval from the agency’s Chief Privacy Officer may be required.</li>
      </ul>
      <h4>Authority to Operate</h4>
      <p>Governed by the <a href="http://csrc.nist.gov/drivers/documents/FISMA-final.pdf" target="blank">Federal Information Security Management Act of 2002</a>, or FISMA, each agency will require an Authority to Operate (ATO) before an IT system is approved to be used within an organization or agency. The ATO represents the agency conducting an appropriate security review of the IT system. There are various types of ATOs, which have different requirements, noted below.</p>
      <p><strong>Agency ATO</strong></p>
      <p>Agency ATOs are issued at the agency level and are approved at the CIO or delegated authority level. The process in which agencies follow to appropriately assess an IT system may vary based on the controls and mechanisms each agency. Typically an associated level of risk</p>
      <p><strong>FedRamp</strong></p>
      <p>The Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program, or <a href="https://www.fedramp.gov" target="blank">FedRAMP</a>, is a government-wide program that provides a standardized approach to security assessment, authorization, and continuous monitoring for cloud products and services. This approach uses a “do once, use many times” framework that saves an estimated 30-40% of government costs, as well as both time and staff required to conduct redundant agency security assessments. FedRAMP is the result of close collaboration with cybersecurity and cloud experts from the General Services Administration (GSA), National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), Department of Homeland Security (DHS), Department of Defense (DOD), National Security Agency (NSA), Office of Management and Budget (OMB), the Federal Chief Information Officer (CIO) Council and its working groups, as well as private industry.</p>
      <p>The cloud systems can take one of three paths to become FedRAMP compliant: JAB Provisional Authorization (P-ATO), Agency Authorization, and CSP Supplied Package. No matter which path a CSP has taken — JAB, Agency, or CSP Supplied — all cloud systems listed here have demonstrate FedRAMP compliance and can be leveraged by any agency. Additional details for each path is listed below.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>JAB Provisional Authorizations:</strong> Cloud systems listed under the FedRAMP P-ATO path have undergone a rigorous technical review by the FedRAMP PMO, been assessed by a FedRAMP accredited 3PAO, and received a P-ATO from the DHS, DOD, and GSA CIOs.</li>
        <li><strong>Agency FedRAMP Authorizations:</strong> Cloud systems listed under the Agency Authorization have worked directly with a customer agency to achieve a FedRAMP compliant ATO that has been verified by the FedRAMP PMO.<br/><br/>FedRAMP Compliant (In PMO Review) is a designation for Agency ATO Authorization Packages only. This designation signifies that the CSP’s cloud system has been granted an ATO by an agency and has submitted all required documentation for review to the FedRAMP PMO. Once the FedRAMP PMO completes an Initial Review of the package the CSP will be listed as FedRAMP Compliant.</li>
        <li><strong>CSP Supplied Packages:</strong> Cloud systems listed under the CSP Supplied Package path have submitted to the FedRAMP PMO a completed Security Assessment Package (SAP) that has been assessed by a FedRAMP accredited 3PAO.</li>
      </ul>
