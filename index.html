      <p>The goal of Apps.Gov is to facilitate an active marketplace to inform government buyers when procuring cloud technologies. This is accomplished by: 1) listing products that have either been through the GSA <a href="cloud-proving-ground/">Cloud Proving Ground</a> program OR been sourced from industry partners who are hosting these products on their FedRamp approved infrastructure and 2) partnering with 18F Consulting to support procurement needs across the federal government.</p>
      <p>Information on the product, company, existing contract vehicles, and security reviews is listed on the <a href="products/">products</a> page. Companies who have or would like products listed on Apps.Gov can elect to have their product further reviewed and tested via the FedRamp process or by the 18F team. Companies are encouraged to update their product information via <a href="https://github.com/presidential-innovation-fellows/apps-gov" target="blank">GitHub</a> for accuracy and competitive advantage.</p>
      <p>If you have any questions regarding Apps.Gov or the Cloud Proving Ground, please reach out to <a href="mailto:cloud-proving-ground@gsa.gov" target="blank">cloud-proving-ground@gsa.gov</a></p>
