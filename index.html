    <h2>What is a "product"?</h2>
    <p>A product on Apps.Gov is a cloud-hosted software technology that doesn't need to be installed on your computer (local machine). These products utilize remotely hosted servers (typically via a cloud service provider) that stores and runs the software, which can then be served to many users. This allows the company to be more cost effective, maintain code and versioning easier. The types of products you'll find on <a href="/">Apps.Gov</a> ranges from productivity products to developer tools and everything in between.</p>
    <h2>How are products selected?</h2>
    <p>The goal of Apps.Gov is to facilitate an active marketplace to inform government buyers when procuring cloud technologies.

    <p>Information on the product, company, existing contract vehicles, and government approvals is listed on the <a href="products/">products</a> page. Companies are encouraged to submit or update their product information via the open source <a href="https://github.com/presidential-innovation-fellows/apps-gov" target="blank">GitHub repository</a> for accuracy and competitive advantage.
