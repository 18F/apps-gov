    <h2>What is a "product"?</h2>
    <p>A product on Apps.Gov is a cloud-hosted software as a service (SaaS) technology that leverages centralized servers (typically using a cloud service provider) to store and serve data for their users. This allows the product to be more cost effective and easier to maintain as well as accessible from multiple devices and locations.</p>
    <h2>How are products selected?</h2>
    <p>The goal of Apps.Gov is to inform and enable government buyers when procuring cloud SaaS technologies. Join the community to learn more and get help with selling to the federal government at <a href="https://discuss.apps.gov" target="blank">https://discuss.apps.gov</a>.</p>
    <p>Information on the product, company, existing contract vehicles, and government approvals is listed for each product on the <a href="products/">products</a> page. Companies are encouraged to submit or update their product information via the open source <a href="https://github.com/presidential-innovation-fellows/apps-gov" target="blank">GitHub repository</a>.
