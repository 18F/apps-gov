    <h2>What is an "app"?</h2>
    <p>An application is a cloud-hosted software technology that doesn't need to be installed on your computer (local machine). These apps utilize remotely hosted servers (typically via a cloud service provider) that stores and runs the software, which can then be served to many users. This allows the company to be more cost effective, maintain code and versioning easier. The types of apps you'll find on <a href="/">Apps.Gov</a> ranges from productivity apps to developer tools and everything in between.</p>
    <h2>How are apps selected?</h2>
    <p>The goal of Apps.Gov is to facilitate an active marketplace to inform government buyers when procuring cloud technologies. Join the community to learn more and get help with selling to the federal government at <a href="https://discuss.apps.gov" target="blank">https://discuss.apps.gov</a>.</p>
    <p>Information on the application, company, existing contract vehicles, and government approvals is listed on the <a href="apps/">apps</a> page. Companies are encouraged to submit or update their app information via the open source <a href="https://github.com/presidential-innovation-fellows/apps-gov" target="blank">GitHub repository</a> for accuracy and competitive advantage.
