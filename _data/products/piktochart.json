    "long_description": "Piktochart offers an infographics app that allows non-designers to create visual\ngraphics to better engage their web audience. It is software which allows users\nwithout intensive experience as graphic designers to create professional-grade\ninfographics by using templates. A particularly critical feature of Piktochart\nis its HTML publishing capability, which generates infographics with multiple\nclickable elements for users, cutting out the necessity of hiring a developer in\norder to create a professional-grade interactive infographic. Piktochart was\nlaunched in March 2012 and is based in Penang, Malaysia. Current stats of number\nof created infographics and sign ups to Piktochart can be found at\nmagic.piktochart.com",
