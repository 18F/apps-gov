The data for pins can come from spreadsheets, crowd source, or Google search. ZeeMaps can automatically update maps from spreadsheets stored on a Google Drive. Some highlights  ZeeMaps are: (1) scalability:from a few markers to tens of thousands of markers, (2) custom fields that can be combined with distance search, and (3) static custom map images in high resolution suitable for publications. Government agencies like CDC and NIH routinely use ZeeMaps for their mapping requirements.",
