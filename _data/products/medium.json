    "long_description": "Medium is rethinking how ideas and stories are shared with the world. We\nbelieve: - Great ideas can come from anywhere - People create better things\ntogether - Design matters at a deep level We also care deeply about how media\nshapes the lives of individuals and the decisions of society — and we think it\ncan be better. We have a world-class engineering and design team, which we are\nlooking to grow slowly and deliberately. Let us know if you're interested."
