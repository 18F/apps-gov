    "long_description": "Disqus is the web’s community of communities. Online communities are where\npeople go to connect with their passions. Disqus makes them better through more\nenjoyable discussions. And then links all those communities so it’s easier to\ndiscover and discuss new stuff worth talking about. Disqus reaches over 1\nbillion people a month, 2.5 million registered communities, and over 100M active\ncommenter profiles. The service offers a networked comment system used to foster\nengagement and connect audiences from around the web. Disqus looks to make it\nvery easy and rewarding for people to interact on websites using its system.\nCommenters can build reputation and carry their contributions from one website\nto the next. Using the Disqus' built-in network effects, bloggers and publishers\ncan expect a higher volume and higher quality of conversations by using the\ndiscussion platform. Disqus was founded in 2007 by Daniel Ha and Jason Yan to\nextract the best characteristics of successful online communities and apply them\non any blog, website, or application."
