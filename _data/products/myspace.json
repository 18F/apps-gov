    "short_description": "MySpace is a social networking site that enables members to make friends, write\nblog posts, add music, and customize their MySpace pages.",
    "long_description": "MySpace is one of the world's largest social networks, with about 125 million\nusers. Originally inspired by\n[Friendster](http://www.crunchbase.com/company/friendster), MySpace quickly grew\nto become the world's largest social network, before being overtaken by\n[Facebook](http://www.crunchbase.com/company/facebook). User pages are highly\ncustomizable and support integration with widgets such as\n[Slide](http://www.crunchbase.com/company/slide) or\n[YouTube](http://www.crunchbase.com/company/youtube). MySpace provides users\nwith a way to connect around content and culture. MySpace was started as a side\nproject of the internet marketing company eUniverse (now called [Intermix\nMedia](http://www.crunchbase.com/company/intermixmedia)) in August 2003. [Brad\nGreenspan](http://www.crunchbase.com/person/brad-greenspan), then founder and\nCEO of eUniverse oversaw the project, which was also led by [Chris\nDeWolfe](http://www.crunchbase.com/person/chris-dewolfe) (later CEO), [Josh\nBerman](http://www.crunchbase.com/person/josh-berman), and [Tom\nAnderson](http://www.crunchbase.com/person/tom-anderson) (soon to be President).\nIt officially launched in January 2004. By February 2004, MySpace reached 1\nmillion registered users. By November 2004, that number had reached 5 million.\nIn July, 2005 [News\nCorporation](http://www.crunchbase.com/company/newscorporation) bought eUniverse\n(renaming it [Intermix Media](http://www.crunchbase.com/company/intermixmedia))\nfor $580 M, of which approximately $327 M was the valuation of MySpace. At this\ntime, the site had 20 million registered users. In mid 2007, [News\nCorporation](http://www.crunchbase.com/company/newscorporation) contemplated\nselling 25% of MySpace stock to\n[Yahoo!](http://www.crunchbase.com/company/yahoo) in a deal that would have\nvalued the site at $12 B, though this never went through. After being acquired,\nMySpace's revenues grew rapidly, as [News\nCorporation](http://www.crunchbase.com/company/newscorporation) pursued\nlucrative advertising deals. In August 2006,\n[Google](http://www.crunchbase.com/company/google) made a $900 M agreement to\nprovide search and advertising directly on the MySpace site, which is set to\nexpire in June 2010. In mid 2008, MySpace participated in a major site redesign.\nThroughout its history, critics have often cited the chaotic and disorganized\ninterface as a severe drawback to usability of the site. This redesign made the\nmain page more streamlined and clean. In late 2006, [Universal Music\nGroup](http://www.crunchbase.com/company/universal-music-group) sued MySpace for\nmillions in damages from copyright infringement. This suit was settled in mid\n2008 by the launch of [MySpace\nMusic](http://www.crunchbase.com/company/myspace-music), a site where users can\nlisten to streaming songs from all sorts of artists. To supplement this venture,\nMySpace acquired [iLike](http://www.crunchbase.com/company/ilike) in mid 2009.\nMySpace had previously also launched a record label in 2005 and musicians such\nas Lily Allen and Sean Kingston were first discovered through MySpace. In mid\n2007, MySpace acquired\n[PhotoBucket](http://www.crunchbase.com/company/photobucket) for $250 M in cash,\nplus an additional $50 M earn-out. By late 2009, [News\nCorporation](http://www.crunchbase.com/company/newscorporation) sold a 2/3 stake\nin [Photobucket](http://www.crunchbase.com/company/photobucket) to a group of\ninvestors valuing the company at $60 M, over 80% less than the acquisition\nprice. Since 2008, user growth has stagnated and page views and other metrics\nhave fallen. In April 2009, longtime CEO and co-founder [Chris\nDeWolfe](http://www.crunchbase.com/person/chris-dewolfe) was replaced by [Owen\nVan Natta](http://www.crunchbase.com/person/owen-van-natta), in a publicized\nfiring. President and head of product, [Tom\nAnderson](http://www.crunchbase.com/person/tom-anderson), was kept on, but in a\ndifferent position. Two months following this, MySpace announced it was laying\noff 30% of its workforce amounting to 420 people. In June 2011, Myspace was\nacquired by Specific Media for a [reported US$35\nmillion](http://techcrunch.com/2011/06/29/myspace-goes-to-specific-media-for-35m-ceo-is-out-press-release/).\nJustin Timberlake also took ownership in this acquisition and will play a strong\nrole in Myspace's future strategy and creative direction."
